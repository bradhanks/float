## Overview

When Brad joined Lucid as their first marketing hire, the company was already growing like wildfire — but they were flying blind. With no formal marketing strategy, the team was relying heavily on word-of-mouth and an army of whiteboard-loving engineers.

Our mission? Take this organic growth and turn it into a predictable, scalable engine. So we did what any rational marketer would do: we built a full-funnel marketing strategy from scratch, implemented K-means clustering for affinity analysis (because why not?), and launched the Salesforce integration in two months — a timeline that made Peterson Ventures question if we’d skipped lunch breaks entirely.

To top it off, Brad became Lucid’s unofficial product whisperer, influencing feature development and building relationships with influencers across industries. He even convinced the dev team to add a “Share to LinkedIn” button directly into the UI — because who doesn’t want to brag about their diagrams?

  If you need something done... really anything done, Brad is the man for the
  job. At Lucid he's helped build the company's freemium model marketing funnel,
  but on the side he's also helped lead efforts in Education and the Salesforce
  integration among other things. The guy knows how to get things done.
