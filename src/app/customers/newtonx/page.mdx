## Executive Summary.

New York-based marketing research firm, NewtonX, built out paid search as
a new marketing channel to accelerate growth during their Series B
fundraising effort. After an initial misfire, paid search added 20% to top-line
revenue with a 100% return on investment. NewtonX raised a $32M Series
B in December, attributing much of its success to “its marketing and sales
teams.
” NextonX had one full-time marketing employee during that period
— the only change being adding Float Consulting as a paid search
consultant.

## Background.
New York-based marketing research firm, NewtonX, sought to accelerate
growth before and during an active fundraising effort to raise an investment
round. They had a robust sales organization with good revenue but hadn’t
yet tapped the growth potential of digital marketing. NewtonX reached out
in February 2021 for a bid on paid search services. After engaging a
different contractor at a lower price point for three (3) months, NewtonX
engaged our services from July to December 2021.

## False Start.
The previous paid search efforts were unsuccessful for the following
reasons:
1. Campaign keywords were overly broad.
2. Campaign ad group design precluded the ability to gain insight on an
individual keyword level.

3. Campaign ads failed to screen out informational searches.
4. Campaign ads didn’t set expectations with a clear call-to-action.
5. The campaign didn’t have a dedicated landing page with a lead form.
6. The campaign tracking wasn’t properly implemented.

## Overview

New York-based B2B research firm NewtonX needed to prove scalable customer acquisition ahead of their Series B round. After an initial failed attempt with another vendor, we rebuilt their paid search strategy to:

- Target high-intent keywords with surgical precision
- Screen out informational searches via ad copy optimization
- Implement closed-loop attribution tying clicks to pipeline revenue
- Design dedicated landing pages that boosted conversions by 15%
