## Topological Invariants

Properties preserved through continuous transformations of customer journeys. These metrics remain stable despite changes in interface layout, content sequencing, or device context.

## Evaluation Touchpoint Threshold

The minimum number of significant interaction points customers require before conversion. This determines journey completion resilience and maps to path-connectedness in experience topology.

## Edge Strength

Quantifies the likelihood of customer transition between journey vertices. Strong edges correlate with intuitive UX pathways and clear value propositions.

## Homeomorphisms

Continuous transformations between journey maps that preserve topological structure. Enables mapping of legacy funnel analytics to modern non-linear journey models.

## Shape-Based Analytics

Analyzes journey topology as geometric entities rather than sequential steps. Reveals hidden patterns like behavioral basins and friction peaks.

<TopTip>
  Visualize journey data through topological lenses using tools like Giotto or
  KeplerMapper. Look for persistent features across scale changes.
</TopTip>

## Continuity

Smooth transitions between journey states without abrupt discontinuities. A continuous journey allows customers to progress without encountering dead-ends or forced handoffs.

## Hausdorff Property

Ensures distinct touchpoints maintain separation in journey mapping. Violations indicate attribution conflicts or overlapping engagement channels.

## Compactness

Finite coverage of journey behaviors through critical path analysis. Helps identify the minimal set of experiences requiring optimization.

## Fundamental Group (π₁)

Captures behavioral loops in customer journeys. Sticky loops indicate engagement strengths, while trivial loops signal drop-off risks.

<Example>
  Pre-Trial phase with π₁ = ⟨a,b|aba⁻¹b⁻¹⟩ suggests torus-like exploration
  patterns requiring cyclical content reinforcement
</Example>

## Spectral Graph Theory

Analyzes journey connectivity through eigenvalues of graph Laplacians. Reveals hidden community structures and natural segmentation boundaries.

## Euler Characteristic

χ = V - E + F quantifies journey complexity in real-time. Sudden changes in χ signal structural instability needing intervention.

## Covering Spaces

Unify cross-device/customer paths into coherent journey representations. Essential for omnichannel experience mapping.

## Seifert-van Kampen Theorem

Decomposes complex journeys into analyzable subspaces. Combine segment insights while preserving boundary condition relationships.

## Connected Sums

Models multi-phase journeys as hybrid topologies. Useful for onboarding-to-retention transitions and feature adoption pathways.

## Compactification

Adds boundary points to represent churn risks. Enables predictive modeling of exit probabilities at journey edges.

## Separation Axioms

Hierarchy of journey space properties ensuring distinct experience states:

- T₁ Spaces: Customers can distinguish between competing offers
- Hausdorff (T₂): Unique attribution for conversion touchpoints

## Moduli Space

Parameterizes journey variations across segments. Reveals optimal intervention points through geometric stability analysis.

## Fiber Bundles

Models contextual layers over core journeys (e.g., device context, account status). Maintains structural integrity during state transitions.

## Cohomology

Detects hidden constraints in journey progression. Nontrivial cohomology classes indicate unobserved barriers affecting conversion.
